                    I’m a front-end web developer with 2.5 years of experience building responsive and user-friendly websites. After finishing my studies, I worked on personal projects before joining a full-time developer role, where I improved my skills in modern UI design.

                    Due to a medical emergency, I took a short break but stayed focused on learning. I'm now doing a hands-on internship to refresh and grow my skills in both front-end and back-end development.
